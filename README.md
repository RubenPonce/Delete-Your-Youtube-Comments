# How to automatically delete your youtube comments
Youtube doesn't provide a way to delete all your comments, so I made one! This will auto delete all your comments, at 1 comment every 400ms. Adjust the speed with the setInterval if you want to take time deleting your comments, I know you probably have some that are decades old and might want to just savior them one last time as you bid them farewell. 

## How to use the script: 
  1. Copy scriptSetup.js 
  2. Open your [comment history](https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/comment_history)
  3. Paste the code into your Google Chrome Dev Tools console 
  4. Sit back as your comments dissolve into thin air!
